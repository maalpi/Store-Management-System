# Store Management System
 Project using SQL and Python that serves both to monitor the merchandise of a store and serves as a cashier. 
 
 --------------------------------- 
 I made this project to study design patterns and UML, that's why there are files named after design patterns (ex: Observer.py)

----------------------------
 It is a very intuitive program, the first time it starts it will automatically create the SQL databases, and whenever the user uses it, he will be asked for a username and password to enter the app (by default it is user: user | password: password).
 
 After the user enters, a panel will appear with options that he can do, for example, register a product, register a sale, change the stock of a product, see the total sales balance, etc...
 
 And it is possible to save or load a ''backup'' in csv or xlsx (the user decides)
 
 OBS: as I am Brazilian and this is a learning project there will be several things typed in Portuguese.
